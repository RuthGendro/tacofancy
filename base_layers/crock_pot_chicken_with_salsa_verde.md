Crock Pot Chicken with Salsa Verde
=====================

* 1 yellow onion
* 1 bell pepper
* 2 lb. chicken pieces*, skins removed
* 1 tsp cumin
* 1/4 tsp salt
* 1/8 tsp garlic powder
* Fresh cracked pepper
* 16 oz. salsa verde

Slice the onion and bell pepper, then lay them into the bottom of a 4-quart or larger slow cooker. Place the chicken pieces on top of the onion and bell peppers. Sprinkle the cumin, salt, garlic powder, and some freshly cracked pepper onto the chicken pieces. Pour the salsa over top.

Cover the slow cooker and cook on high for four hours or low for 8 hours. I recommend low, as it will make the chicken more tender and flavorful.

After cooking, carefully remove the chicken pieces with tongs. Use the tongs to retrieve the onion and bell peppers from the liquid in the slow cooker. Use this mixture for your base.

Suggested toppings: Black beans, pico de gallo, guacamole, cilantro, queso fresco / cotija / monterey jack / cheddar cheese, thinly sliced jalepenos, and / or lime.

*You can use any type of chicken you like (drumsticks, thighs, breasts), bone-in or boneless. Just be sure to remove the skin before cooking.
